                    I am a data scientist with thorough applied mathematics and computer science training. My goal is 
                    to promote ethical machine learning and artificial intelligence in data privacy, space exploration, medicine, non-profits,
                    data modeling, and software development.

                    I am currently studying at Harvard University for my Master's of Science in Data Science. I hold a Bachelor of Science from 
                    Marist College in Data Science & Analytics and Applied Mathematics.

                    I've done course-based academic research in bayesian analysis on ecological data, dynamic system modeling with epidemiology (COVID),
                    sentiment analysis as applied to news truthfulness, cosmological machine learning, and an expose on Twin Primes.

                    I have also officially researched through PolyMath Jr., working with Markov Chains, artificial intelligence methods,
                    and abstract algebra to produce a mathematically strategic paper on traditional strategy games Tapatan and Picaria.
